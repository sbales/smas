For the past 49 years, the Springfield Mid-America Singers have had the central goal of engaging people in the community in the magic of choral music, endeavoring to touch the soul with our singing.  We continue that tradition this season with music that tells a story.     

While our concerts are offered free to the public, we need your support to continue the choral arts.  As we plan our upcoming 50th Year Anniversary, we value any contribution toward our plans for a grand celebration to be shared with the public.
Thank you.
